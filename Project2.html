                Reading gives us someplace to go when we have to stay where we are. -

            The history of the book starts with the development of writing, and
            various other inventions such as paper and printing, and continues
            through to the modern-day business of book printing. <br />
            The earliest knowledge society has on the history of books actually
            predates what would conventionally be called "books" today and begins
            with scrolls, and sheets of papyrus.
